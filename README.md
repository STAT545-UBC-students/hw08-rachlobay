# STAT 547 HW08 Creation of Diamonds App

## What is the app?

For my app, I used the diamonds dataset, which comes with the ggplot2 package. So, we get this data set when we load the tidyverse package. 
The aim of this app is to use graphs, interactive tables and widgits to sort and display the data. 

I referred to [this tutorial](https://plot.ly/r/shiny-tutorial/) for the base of the code used to incorporate plotly into my app.
